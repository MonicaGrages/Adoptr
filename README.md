# Adoptr
## helping four-legged friends find fur-ever homes

### An AngularJS on rails app I planned, designed, and developed in one week

### Cool things I learned about during this project:
- Angular Material - swipes
- Windows - jquery plugin for window-snap scrolling (super cool thing but I ended up abandoning because it didn't work so well in production)
- Devise-token-auth/ng-token-auth
- Angular-socialshare
- Font Awesome - so many icons
- Sass
